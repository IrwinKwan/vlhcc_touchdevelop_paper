\section{Method}

To conduct our study, we used the public TouchDevelop API to extract 35000 scripts which we stored in a MySQL database.

\subsection{Analysis}

We used SQL queries and statistical methods to examine our data. We identified that tutorials were tagged with the \#doc hashtag and that there are a total of XX tutorials.

\boldnote{When appropriate, we removed some usernames from our analysis.}
We contacted the TouchDevelop team and learned further that certain author names, including ``TouchDevelop Samples'' and ``TouchDevelop Documentation'', were operated by Microsoft employees; in our author data analysis we remove these from the analysis. \note{Be really specific when we actually do this. we might have to rewrite this statement}
