In general, TouchDevelop script authors are only somewhat willing to attempt tutorials.
Of the \numauthors{} users who have published at least one script, we observed that only \authorsUsedTutorials{} (7.2\%) attempted a tutorial and only \totalcompletions{} (4.2\%) of all users completed one or more tutorials.

% Some notes about the tutorials:
% first steps with drawing https://www.touchdevelop.com/api/ayyxc is no longer available publically, it can't be accessed.

One severe limitation of this data is that there are very few attempts on tutorials. One reason for this would be because of data collection. Since we could only collect published scripts, authors who attempted tutorials but did not finish them would have to publish them explicitly, which would not be expected if the script is unfinished or not working.

\note{Implication?} Despite this finding, our data still shows that a large number of users have successfully published scripts. This suggests that many TouchDevelop users are either familiar with programming and did not require tutorials or that they learned or were taught TouchDevelop offline (for example, as part of an outreach effort or by friends). There is also the possibility that users generally avoided the official tutorials and used other resources, but non-Microsoft tutorials are rather rare. \note{One way to explore this further is to examine the features of scripts that people who didn't use tutorials had. If they are filled with advanced constructs then we can assume that they have some prior knowledge}


\note{Data limitation: it seems that physics game walkthrough and Bounce (physics) have code fragment overlaps, as they co-occur in the database. For this reason we should consider them to be a single data point, we cannot read into it further.}
